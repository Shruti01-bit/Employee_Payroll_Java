## Employee_Payroll_Java
This project is a Java-based Employee Payroll System created as part of learning Object-Oriented Programming. The application runs in the terminal and allows users to manage employee details and compute salaries for different employee categories. It is designed to strengthen understanding of abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism through practical implementation.

## Project Feature
Abstract Employee class as the base structure.

FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee subclasses with separate salary calculations.

Simple and interactive terminal-based user interface.

Clear implementation of core OOP principles.

Easy-to-read and well-structured Java code.
